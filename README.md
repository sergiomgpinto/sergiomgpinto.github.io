# Sérgio Pinto - Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which showcases my professional experience and projects.

## Technologies

My personal website is built using a modern stack of web technologies, ensuring a fast, interactive, and responsive user experience. Here's a breakdown:

**Frontend:**

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling dynamic and efficient rendering.
*   **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a smooth development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling components and building responsive layouts.
*   **Framer Motion:** A library for creating animations and transitions, adding visual flair to the website.

**Styling:**

*   **Tailwind CSS:** As mentioned above, Tailwind CSS is the primary styling tool, offering a vast collection of utility classes.

**Development Tools:**

*   **ESLint:** Enforces code quality and consistency by identifying and reporting on problematic patterns.
*   **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code maintainability and reducing errors.

**Deployment:**

*   **GitHub Pages:** The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, leveraging its static site hosting capabilities.
*   **gh-pages:** An npm package used to deploy the website to GitHub Pages


## Development

To run the website locally for development or testing purposes, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sergiomgpinto/sergiomgpinto.github.io.git
    cd sergiomgpinto.github.io
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will typically start the development server and make the website accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or a different port if 8080 is in use).
